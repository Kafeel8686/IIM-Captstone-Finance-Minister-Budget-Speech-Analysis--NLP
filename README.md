Finance Minister Budget Speech Analysis from 2010 -2019

Project Description:

Ministry of Finance has a very major role to play in economic growth for a nation and it’s critical for the nation to fall in good hands. What if you could understand how well a Politician would do wearing a hat of a Finance Minister way before time. Wouldn’t that be fantastic? What’s available with us is budget speech data from the last decade. And would be interesting to know the following (and the list would grow even further):

Question:
1. What was each minister’s financial focus? Was there a significant change in those sectors in the following year?
2. Can you find out to what extent a finance minister makes fake commitment in the speech?
3. Can you find similarities between the speeches from different ministers and hence find out persistent economical issues Ministry of Finance has been trying to solve in the last Decade?
4. Does the tone of the budget speech (Using information like Phrases used, sentiment, length, etc.) has a correlation with its possible outcome?
5. Can you score each finance minister based on their effectiveness?
6. Can you find the sectors that needs special attention but hasn’t been getting any?
7. From the speeches, can we list down features required for someone to run a Ministry of Finance effectively?
